===========

This is the new daveops.net, my little repo of code snippets and chunks of
wisdom that's in no particular organized state.

The formatting of some pages are likely wrong, as many of the pages were
ripped out of Tiddlywiki (which was no longer up to the task). The new engine
(Pelican static site generator) should make it easier for me to add and
update the pages. There's little priority to fix these items - they'll be
fixed on a as-used basis (I don't use a bunch of this stuff personally
anymore)

Pull requests are appreciated, but added at my discretion.

Note - there are chunks of the site missing from the git repo at this time
because some of the plugins/themes used to create the static site have
no/unclear distribution terms. I'll try to figure something out, but it's not
a priority for me at this time.
