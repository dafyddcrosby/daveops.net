===== Compression =====
caveat - compression is *not* retroactive, so you should set it on the pool
immediately after creation

::

 # See compression settings
 zfs get compression
 # See compression efficiency
 zfs get compressratio
 # Set compression (types: lzjb, lz4, gzip-[1-9])
 zfs set compression=<type> <pool>

===== Delegate administrative tasks =====

::

 zfs allow

===== Snapshots =====
::

  # List snapshots
  zfs list -t snapshot
  # Delete a snapshot
  zfs destroy tank/home/thing@tuesday

===== Rollback =====

By default, ZFS rollback cannot revert to anything beyond the most recent snapshot. -r lets you go earlier, although this is a destructive operation and deletes the intermediate snapshots

::

  zfs rollback tanks/home/dave@tuesday

===== See disks =====
::

  zpool list
