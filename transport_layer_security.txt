Here's a quick checklist of best practices as of this writing. It is by no
means complete, but should get you well on your way.

===== Stop using =====

- aNULL non-authenticated DH exchanges (MITM attack)
- eNULL (cleartext)
- SSL2 (DROWN attack)
- SSL3 (POODLE attack)
- RC4 (see: RFC 7465 and https://blog.cloudflare.com/killing-rc4-the-long-goodbye/ )
- MD5 (collisions are trivial)
- EXPORT ciphers (deliberately weakened)
- DES (deprecated Data Encryption Standard)
- 3DES (`Sweet32 attack <https://sweet32.info/>`_)
- Weak Diffie-Hellman parameters ([[https://weakdh.org|Logjam attack]])
- SHA1 (`SHAttered attack <https://shattered.io>`_)

===== Start using =====

- HTTP Strict Transport Security (RFC 6797)
