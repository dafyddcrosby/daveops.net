* Users should always be able to pause and return
* Incorporate resting positions
* Always test with newcomers
	* Those experienced with VR become accustomed to it, don't notice what would be discomfortable to newcomer
* Always start easy - not with hectic action
* Don't waste time - folks in VR can't log off for 5 seconds while waiting
