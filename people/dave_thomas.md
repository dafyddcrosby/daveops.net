[Agile is Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M)

Agility - what to do
* Find out where you are
* Take a small step towards your goal
* Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
* Repeat
Agility - how to do it
* When faced with two or more alternatives that deliver roughly the same value,
  take the path that makes future changes easier

> No rules are universal (except this one)
