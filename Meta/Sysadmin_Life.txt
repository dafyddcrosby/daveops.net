====== Sysadmin Life ======
:date: 2016-4-17

- Write great documentation, not necessarily for others, but for your own sanity
- Assume that you typing something in is the weakest link in any chain. If it can be automated, it should be.

===== Outside of work =====

- Sleep is precious. Invest in a nice bed, keep light out of the room, keep caffeinated substance consumption to a minimum.
- If you're on-call, assume things will break any minute. Shower, middle of a meal, while you're hanging a chandelier. Usually the most inconvenient time.
