Note: This information is generally geared to the 68000 specifically (for use with the Sega Genesis), later processor models have more/enhanced instructions :-)

## ISA

field | desc
---   | ---
#X    | immediate (raw) data
ea    | effective address (data register or memory address)
An    | address register
Dn    | data register
Rn    | any register

Mnemonic     | Sizes | Desc
---          | ---   | ---
add ea,ea    | b,w,l | Add source to destination (either needs to be Dn)
addi #X,ea   | b,w,l | Add source to destination (either needs to be Dn)
bCC label    | b,w   | See Condition Code test table (68020+ supports long)
bchg Dn,ea   | b,l   | test a bit in destination operand, set Z code, flip bit
bclr Dn,ea   | b,l   | test a bit in destination operand, set Z code, set bit to 0
bset Dn,ea   | b,l   | test a bit in destination operand, set Z code, set bit to 1
clr ea       | b,w,l | Zero out destination
eor Dn,ea    | b,w,l | Exclusive OR (XOR)
exg Rn       | l     | Exchange registers
lea ea,An    | l     | Load effective address into an address register
move ea,ea   | b,w,l | Move source ea to dest ea (assembler converts to movea if uses direct register)
movea ea,An  | w,l   | Move ea to address register
moveq #x, Dn | l     | Move immediate long to data register
not ea       | b,w,l | Flip bits of effective address
swap Dn      | w     | Swap upper word with lower word
tst ea       | b,w,l | test an operand (sets Z if operand zero)

Only byte-sizes can use odd addressing (word+long crash).

### Condition Code Tests

Mnemonic | Condition
---      | ---
CC(HI)   | Carry Clear
CS(LO)   | Carry Set
EQ       | Equal
GE       | Greater or Equal
GT       | Greater Than
HI       | High
LE       | Less or Equal
LS       | Low or Same
LT       | Less Than
MI       | Minus
NE       | Not Equal
PL       | Plus
VC       | Overflow Clear
VS       | Overflow Set

### Condition codes

code | condition
---  | ---
X    | ?
N    | Negative
Z    | Zero
V    | Overflow
C    | Carry

## Motorola assembly syntax

```asm
; mnemonic.size source,destination
```

Size is 'b' (byte), 'w' (word), or 'l' (long)

operand    | desc
---        | ---
$00000042  | memory address of 00000042
#42        | decimal 42 literal
#$42       | hexadecimal 42 literal
#%01000010 | binary 42 literal
a0         | address register 0
d0         | data register 0
$42(a0)    | add offset of 42 to address register 0
(a0)+      | increment address register 0 (register incremented after instruction)
-(a0)      | decrement address register 0 (register decreased before instruction)
