===== Misc Notes =====
* Don't cast returned pointers from malloc. (void \*) should get automatically promoted to any pointer type, and casting just makes it likely you'll get it wrong.
* Free allocated memory when you are done with it, don't assume that OS will clean up your mess.

===== To verify =====
[ ] C compiler will create implicit declaration of function, which can be satisfied at link time
[ ] Difference between exit values in ANSI C, K+R, C99
[ ] Are return values typically passed in a register?
