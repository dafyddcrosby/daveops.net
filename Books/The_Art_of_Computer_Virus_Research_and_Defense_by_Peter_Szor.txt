[[Core War]]

''Instead of writing computer viruses, I strongly recommend playing this harmless and interesting gam. In fact, if worms fascinate you, a new version of Corw Wars can be created to link battles in different networks and allow warrior programs to jump from one battle to another to fight new enemies on those machines. Evolving the game to be more networked allows for simulating worm-like warrior programs.''
