What's a crucial convo?
-----------------------
- different opinions
- stakes are high
- emotions run strong

The results of a crucial conversation have high impact on quality of life

Given choices on approach, we can:

- avoid them
- face them, handle poorly
- face them, handle well

(I suspect there's actually a larger spectrum than 3 choices ;-)

Crucial conversations are frequently spontaneous, catching you off-guard

Common crucial conversations include:

- Ending a relationship
- Talking to a coworker who behaves offensively or makes suggestive comments
- Asking a friend to repay a loan
- Giving the boss feedback about her behavior
- Approaching a boss who is breaking his own safety or quality policies
- Critiquing a colleague's work
- Asking a roommate to move out
- Resolving custody or visitation issues with an ex-spouse
- Dealing with a rebellious teen
- Talking to a team member who isn't keeping commitments
- Discussing problems with sexual intimacy
- Confronting a loved one about a substance abuse problem
- Talking to a colleague who is hoarding information or resources
- Giving an unfavorable performance review
- Asking in-laws to quit interfering
- Talking to a coworker about a personal hygiene problem

   The Law of Crucial Conversations
   At the heart of almost all chronic problems in our organizations, our teams,
   and our relationships lie crucial conversations—ones that we’re either not
   holding or not holding well. Twenty years of research involving more than
   100,000 people reveals that the key skill of effective leaders, teammates,
   parents, and loved ones is the capacity to skillfully address emotionally
   and politically risky issues.
