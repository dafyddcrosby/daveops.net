Meetings
========

* Meetings
* Start of the meeting
** Give at least 30m notice, in addition to any extra time people might need to gather information
** Everything on the table, no surprises
** Don't start just before your lunch or before the end of the business day when people will be leaving
** Have an agenda with stated goals and a scheduled end time
** If you're going to use the projector or teleconferencing, come in 5m earlier than start time so you don't bungle the first critical minutes
* During the meeting
** Don't marry your ideas - be open to suitable alternatives
** Keep a list of actionable items
** Be objective
** When it seems that a conversation is going into technical details best handled outside of the meeting, say so, try to get back to the agenda
* End of the meeting
** At scheduled endtime, decide if you need to continue. Let people who need to leave go, and maybe take a 5 minute breather to clear your head. Set a new end time.
** Do a quick overview of the action items, confirm you've hit all agenda points.
* Conclusions
