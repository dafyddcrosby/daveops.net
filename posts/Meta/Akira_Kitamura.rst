Game designer of Mega Man

  Kitamura: Going through all those games taught me something important, though. I started to think that if I focused on more detailed, intricate enemy behavior and placement, then I could probably achieve a better difficulty balance than what action games had offered so far.
  
  Ariga: I think that attitude become one of the key elements of the Mega Man series.
  
  Kitamura: Also, two of my personal goals for Mega Man were to create a game where all the stages could be cleared in an hour, and to make something that players would want to come back to again and again. To that end, I actually calculated the total number of stages by measuring Mega Man’s walking speed and seeing how long it would take to get through each stage. I then split that up so that the first half of the game would be the robot master stages, and the second would be the Wily stages.
  
  Ariga: Whoa! You really did that?
  
  Kitamura: I also created some rules for myself about enemy placement and design.
  
  #1: Single, weak little enemies would appear in “waves” of 3 or 4 individuals (and to the extent possible, I’d avoid mixing up multiple enemies);
  
  #2: they would all use the same attacks;
  
  #3: I would use differences in terrain and enemy placement to adjust the difficulty of a given section;
  
  #4: The difficulty of each enemy in the wave would gradually rise, but the last enemy to appear would be easier.
