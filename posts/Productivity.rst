General life hacks
------------------
Mold your life so that the path of least resistance is the path of maximum productivity -Matt Might

* `LeechBlock <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock/>`_
  - Good if you want to stop checking slashdot 30 times a day

Computing
---------

* `Learn to touch type <http://10fastfingers.com/>`_
  - The effort you spend getting to 70-80 WPM is far outweighed in time saved over your life.

* Learn your editor inside out

Delegation
----------

- Assistants generally excel at maintaining systems, not creating them. *You* should have the big picture in your head.
- Have a documented process. Questions mean the process isn't documented well enough.

Time Management
---------------

- Set 3 important tasks for the day, every day. Guard your time so that these three things always get done

Office organization
-------------------

- Identify problem spots first.
