Operations checklist
====================
:date: 2016-04-07

This is a checklist of things that I think an operations team needs to get to a
pretty good state. By no means exhaustive, and a bit opinionated. What I think
is most important is at the top, but really should try to have all of them.

- Bug tracker/task manager
- Version control
  CVS, SVN, git, doesn't matter which. Can you see when a file was changed, and by whom?
- Monitoring systems
- Configuration management
- Inventory system
  Can you, in less than 5 minutes, say how many machines (physical and virtual) you have running?
- *Fully* automatic installs
- clear deliverables
- Have an update process
  It is extremely important to have everything patched and up-to-date. This
  includes all hardware, networking devices, you name it. You'll want to know
  where and how to download the updates, how to install the updates, how to
  back out of a bad update, and a rough estimate of how long an update
  typically takes.
