Security - Concepts

Principle of Least Privilege
----------------------------
when designing a security policy, be it a firewall rule, or filesystem
permissions, never give more than the necessary permissions to get the job
done. Doing so reduces the attack surface, and weakens (though does not eliminate)
the potency of compromise. It's easier to loosen rules than to tighten them later.
