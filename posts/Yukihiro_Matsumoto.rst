"...computers don't mind if I must make effort to communicate with them
or if it is easy to communicate with them. They don't care if I put the
numbers of instruction byte sequences in a file and feed it to them to
run, or if a very high level language generated the instructions. The
computers don't care. We humans care about the effort we pay. Often
people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They
think, "By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the
machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will
something something something." They are focusing on machines. But in
fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing
programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the
masters. They are the slaves."
