====== Debugging ======

'''
Debugging is the process by which we understand pathological behavior in a software system

The essence of debugging is asking and answering questions - and the craft of writing 
debuggable software is allowing the software to be able to answer questions about itself.

Recovery in lieu of understanding normalizes broken software.
